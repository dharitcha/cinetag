# ðŸŽ¥ Cinetag - Video Streaming Platform

## Overview
Cinetag was developed as part of the React course in the Alura and Oracle Next Education (ONE) program. The objective was to build a React-based API from scratch, following a Figma design. The project utilizes `json-server` to create a dynamic API and practice essential React functionalities.
